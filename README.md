# Hatched Analytics Data Engineering Assessment
Description
This project involves transforming period-based order index data (monthly, weekly, quarterly, etc.) into daily values and building a forecasting pipeline to estimate quarterly totals mid-quarter using linear extrapolation and seasonal patterns. The solution is implemented in Python with Pandas, with notes on scaling to Spark/Scala for production datasets.
